# duplicate_destroyer

Destroy them nasty dupes \m/.

Just a small utility to get rid of duplicate files. It is an example of how not to write software. It is nowhere near being complete, and it's not tested at all.

I highly recommend not using it, especially if you're gonna use it on your work laptop and you love your job.

Happy annihilating.
